# Bitcoin-Halving
***A quick look at Bitcoin prices when they reach halving.***

## Background
There has been a lot of talk and excitement around Bitcoin's upcoming halving, which is expected in April, 2022.  A lot of chatter has been around the value of Bitcoin going up because there will be more scarcity.  I've been reading that people think that Bitcoin value will spike right before the halving, then take a drop, before rising again.  I wanted to visually see what the historical data seems to show.

The purpose of this simple project is to see the Bitcoin price trends around the Bitcoin halving dates.  I chose 1 month before, and 5 months after halving date, to give a 6-month snapshot of Bitcoin prices.

The previous Bitcoin halving dates were November 28, 2012, July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020.  The next expected halving date is estimated to be in April, 2022.

Historical data from Yahoo Finance only goes back to 09/17/2014, so the Nov 28, 2012 halving could not be analyzed

## What Is Halving?
Bitcoin halving is something that happens every four years or so.  It basically reduces the reward miners (people who process the block-chains and verifies Bitcoin transactions) recieve by half.  This is coded into Bitcoin's structure to control the supply and reduce inflation. As a result, the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated slows down, making it more scarce and, in theory, drives up the value due to increased demand in relation to the supply.

Disclaimer:  I know very little about Bitcoin, and I understand there is a lot more analytics and complex projections for this speculative investing.  This was a simple exercise to visualize what others are talking about.
